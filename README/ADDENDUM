Addendum to the license of the x4 Compiler
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unless otherwise stated, the entire sources for the x4 compiler are
released under a modifed LGPL licence allowing you to use x4 to create
commercial applications without requiring that you release your source
code.

This means that as long as you compiled your application using THIS
compiler none of your applications sources shall be subject to any part of
any variaton of the GPL licence.  If however you take part of this
compiler and use it wihtin your own compiler without permission then your
compiler in it's entirety shall be coverd by MY license.

This applies to any part of the x4 compiler sources other than those which
might be overed by "acceptable use".  For example, I cannot in good faith
claim any copyright on the forth word ?: even though I have never seen
it's like in any other Forth compiler.  If you place a definition for ?:
or other such words within your compiler then that would be considerd an
acceptable use.  I claim no copyright on any individual Forth
definitions, even the ones I think I invented.

If however you take the entire curses module or the memory manager or some
other such module in part or in full without prior permission then this
shall not be coverd by acceptable use and you shall be required to release
100% of your sources under my modified LGPL license.

Permission to use any module within the x4 source tree is hereby granted
to Forth Inc and to Ron Oliver.  Though...  I doubt either will :)
